abstract: Across four studies (3 experimental, total n = 199; 1 archival, n = 186,000)
  we provide evidence that people hold the belief that the world is growing morally
  worse, and that this belief is consistent across generational, political, and religious
  lines. When asked directly about which aspects of society are getting better and
  which are getting worse, people are more likely to list the moral (compared to non-moral)
  aspects as getting worse (Studies 1-2). When provided with a list of items that
  are either moral or non-moral, people are more likely to report that moral (compared
  to non-moral) items are worsening (Study 3). Finally, when asked the question “What
  is the most important problem facing America today?” participants in a nationally
  representative survey (Heffington et al., 2019), disproportionately listed problems
  that fall within the moral domain (Study 4).
