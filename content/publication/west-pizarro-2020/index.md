abstract: 'In four studies (3 experimental, *n<sub> total</sub>* = 199; 1 archival, *n* = 186,000) we find that people believe the world is growing morally worse, and that this belief persists across generational, political, or religious lines. When asked to list things that are getting better and getting worse in society, people are more likely to list items that fall within the moral domain as getting worse than getting better, while the opposite is true for amoral items (Studies 1-2). When asked to categorize morally relevant or irrelevant items as getting better or worse, people categorize morally relevant items as worsening more frequently than they do morally irrelevant items (Study 3). Finally, in a nationally representative dataset compiling responses to the survey question “What is the most important problem facing America today?” (Heﬀington et al., 2019), we found that people disproportionately tend to list problems that fall within the moral domain.'
