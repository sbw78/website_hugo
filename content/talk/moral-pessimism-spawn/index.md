summary: "Symposium talk at the Conference of Social Psychologists around Western New York (SPAWN)"
abstract: "Many aspects of human life have improved over time. Mortality rates have 
fallen, interpersonal violence has waned, and technology has enhanced the lives 
of people around the world. However, people seem to be pessimistic about human 
progress in moral terms. In four experimental studies and one large dataset 
study (which contains approximately 80 years of nationally representative 
data), I provide evidence for this asymmetry between positive change in the 
quality of human life and negative evaluations of moral progress. This 
asymmetry is general, crossing divides of age, ideology, education, income, 
and religious belief."
