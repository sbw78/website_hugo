I am a fourth-year PhD student in social psychology working with [David Pizarro](http://www.peezer.net/), [Tom Gilovich](http://blogs.cornell.edu/tgilovich/), and [Melissa Ferguson](http://melissaferguson.squarespace.com/). My research interests focus on how moral judgment, political ideology, and religious belief interact with and influence one another, and the ways in which those relationships impact intergroup behavior, social change, and how we perceive others.

Prior to starting my graduate work at [Cornell](https://psychology.cornell.edu/), I completed a post-baccalaureate certificate in Psychology & Social Behavior at [UC Irvine](https://ps.soceco.uci.edu/), where I worked with [Jacqueline Chen](https://jacquelinemchen.wixsite.com/sciplab), [Paul Piff](https://paulpiff.wixsite.com/meshlab), [Pete Ditto](https://sites.uci.edu/peterdittolab/), and [Azim Shariff](https://sharifflab.com/).
